### Hello, I'm **Antoine**! 🖐️

I'm passionate about the world of **cryptography** and **blockchain technologies**. As a developer, I specialize in crafting **secure** and **efficient** decentralized applications (**DApps**). If you are interested in exploring my projects, feel free to check out my repositories.

#### 🔐 Cryptography Enthusiast | ⛓️ Blockchain Developer | 💻 DeFi Optimist

I am currently dedicated to honing my testing skills. Leveraging Foundry, I write tests in Solidity and aim to achieve 100% coverage in my projects! 
Embracing the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, I'm on a journey to cultivate an inclination for green tests.

Truly interested in zero-knowledge proofs, I enrolled in zk-learning MOOC: [zk-learning MOOC](https://zk-learning.org/).
In the process of learning zk-SNARKs, I am exploring Noir. For the zk-STARKs, I am also focusing on Cairo.
